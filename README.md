#LIBFT

- This project is about understanding and rewriting basic c functions. Especially for the string process and using the memory dynamically and efficiently.

#FT_PRINTF

- In this project I wrote some formats of printf function on my own way to understand the original printf function and variadic functions. 

#GET_NEXT_LINE
- In this project I wrote a function which is very needed in c language. It basicly works like get_line function in c++(https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/getline) in a different way.

#PIPEX
- In this project I simulated basic bash commands using single pipe. I tried to show how bash works while processing commands, pipes, redirections in a basic way in c language.

#FDF
- In this project I tried to show how graphics and drawing in digital works. By using mlx graphic library I wrote a c program which takes a map and visualize it in 3D by processing pixel by pixel.

#PHILOSOPHERS
- In this project I tried to show multithread programs works. I used terms like p_thread, p_thread_mutex, mutex_lock, mutex_unlock etc. to simulate popular "the philosophers problem".

#PUSH_SWAP
- In this project I created two arrays works like a stack which is not available in c language as a data structure example. By using these two arrays I sort the numbers which is given as command line arguments.

#MINISHELL
- In this project I created a program which works like exactly like bash in c language except for certain inputs like ";", "&&", "||", "not ended quote". I used execve function to execute commands and used readline function to get input.
